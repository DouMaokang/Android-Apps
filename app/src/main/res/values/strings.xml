        Different languages have different rules for grammatical agreement with quantity.
        \n\nIn English, for example, the quantity 1 is a special case. We write "1 book", but for any other quantity we\'d write "n books".
        \n\nThis distinction between singular and plural is very common, but other languages make finer distinctions.
        \n\nThe full set supported by Android is zero, one, two, few, many, and other.
